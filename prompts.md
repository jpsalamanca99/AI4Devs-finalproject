## 1. Descripción general del producto

**Prompt 1:**
Do you the tournament model where, given a list of playes, they are divided in many regular goups to play matches amongs them, then the best two player advance to a direc elimination phase?

**Respuesta:**
Yes, that sounds like a common tournament format! In this model, players are divided into groups, often called round-robin groups, where each player competes against every other player in their group. After all the matches are played, the top two players from each group advance to a single-elimination phase, where they compete in knockout rounds until a champion is determined. This format ensures that players have multiple chances to compete before the final elimination rounds. Do you have a specific tournament in mind, or are you thinking about organizing one?

**Prompt 2:**
I want to create an assistant in organising tournaments with the format described above, the organiser must consist of at least 3 diferent software applications, a web frontend based in react, an API backend based in the express library from node.js, and a database to store the players, the matches of the tournament and the result of the tournament itself. Can you give me a roadmap to create said organiser?

**Respuesta:**
Creating a tournament organizer with the specified format is an exciting project! Here’s a structured roadmap to help you get started:

### 1. **Project Planning**

- **Define Requirements:**
  - User roles (organizer, players)
  - Features (registration, match scheduling, result tracking, etc.)
  
- **Wireframe Design:**
  - Create wireframes for the web frontend to visualize the user interface.

### 2. **Setup Development Environment**

- **Tools and Technologies:**
  - **Frontend:** React, Redux (optional for state management)
  - **Backend:** Node.js, Express
  - **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL)
  - **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

### 3. **Database Design**

- **Schema Design:**
  - **Players:** ID, name, contact info, etc.
  - **Tournaments:** ID, name, date, format, etc.
  - **Matches:** ID, player1_id, player2_id, result, group_id, etc.
  - **Groups:** ID, tournament_id, group_number, player_ids

- **Database Setup:**
  - Set up your chosen database and create the necessary collections/tables based on your schema.

### 4. **Backend Development**

- **Initialize Express Application:**
  - Set up a new Express project and configure middleware (CORS, body-parser).

- **Create API Endpoints:**
  - **Player Routes:** Register players, retrieve player data
  - **Tournament Routes:** Create tournaments, retrieve tournament data
  - **Match Routes:** Schedule matches, update results, retrieve match data
  - **Group Routes:** Create groups, retrieve group standings

- **Connect to Database:**
  - Use an ORM like Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for SQL) to manage database interactions.

### 5. **Frontend Development**

- **Set Up React Application:**
  - Initialize a new React app using Create React App.

- **Build Components:**
  - **Registration Form:** For players to sign up
  - **Tournament Dashboard:** View tournament details and standings
  - **Match Scheduler:** Interface to schedule matches and input results
  - **Group Standings:** Display group standings and match outcomes

- **State Management:**
  - Use React context or Redux to manage application state and handle API calls.

### 6. **Implement Tournament Logic**

- **Group Stage Logic:**
  - Implement functions to schedule matches and determine standings based on results.

- **Elimination Phase Logic:**
  - Implement logic to advance players from groups to the knockout stage.

### 7. **Testing**

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for backend API routes using tools like Jest or Mocha.
  
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Test the interactions between the frontend and backend.

- **User Testing:**
  - Conduct usability tests with potential users to gather feedback on the interface and workflow.

### 8. **Deployment**

- **Choose Hosting:**
  - For the frontend: Vercel or Netlify
  - For the backend: Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean
  - For the database: MongoDB Atlas (if using MongoDB) or a managed PostgreSQL service

- **CI/CD Setup:**
  - Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.

### 9. **Documentation**

- **User Guide:**
  - Create documentation for users explaining how to navigate the application.

- **Developer Documentation:**
  - Document the API endpoints, database schema, and overall architecture for future developers.

### 10. **Future Improvements**

- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Gather feedback and iterate on features.
  
- **Add Features:**
  - Consider adding additional features like notifications, analytics, or advanced matchmaking.

This roadmap provides a comprehensive approach to developing your tournament organizer. Good luck with your project! If you have any specific questions along the way, feel free to ask!

### 3. Modelo de Datos
Los siguientes prompts siguen la conversación del apartado 2.1

**Prompt 1:**
For the data model I have the following entities:

- organizer
- tournament
- player
- match
- group
- breacket

The relations are as follows:

- An organizer has many tournaments
- A tournament has many groups
- A group belongs only to one tournament
- A tournament has many brackets
- A bracket belongs to only one tournament
- A tournament has many players
- Many playes can paticipate in many tournaments
- A player plays one match
- A match is played by one player

Given the above entities and relations generate a plantUML entity relation diagram

**Respuesta:**
```
@startuml
entity "Organizer" as Organizer {
    + id : int
    + name : string
}

entity "Tournament" as Tournament {
    + id : int
    + name : string
    + date : date
}

entity "Group" as Group {
    + id : int
    + group_number : int
}

entity "Bracket" as Bracket {
    + id : int
}

entity "Player" as Player {
    + id : int
    + name : string
}

entity "Match" as Match {
    + id : int
}

Organizer ||--o{ Tournament : "has many"
Tournament ||--o{ Group : "has many"
Tournament ||--o{ Bracket : "has many"
Tournament ||--o{ Player : "has many"
Player }o--o{ Tournament : "participates in"
Player ||--o{ Match : "plays"
Match ||--|| Player : "is played by"

@enduml

### 5. Historias de Usuario
Estos prompts siguen la conversación del apartado 4

**Prompt 1:**
Using as a base the road map and the next description of the functionality of the assistant, create user stories



The assistant must allow a person log in as an organizer of a tournament using the nid, then the organizer must select the list of players who will play the tournament, the total of players must be less or equal to 64 players, the existing players in the database will apear in a list to pick them and there will bin an option to create a new player. If there are less than 64 players in the list the remaining places will be filled by a "bye player". After the list of players is ready the assistant will generate 16 diferent groups of 4 players, without repiting players among the goups; to each group a number between 1 and 8 will be assigned representing the table in wich the matches will be played. For each group the assistant will create 6 matches, one for each different pair of players in the group. For each match the assistant will be able to collect the results of the three sets that will be played and will set the winer of the match. After every match in every group is played the assistant will pick the two best players in every group and generate the direct elimination brackets. The result of each bracket match will determine the player who advances to the next stage until the final match is played and the champion is decided.

**Respuesta:**

Here are user stories based on your roadmap and the functionality description of the tournament assistant:

User Stories
1. User Authentication
    * As an organizer, I want to log in using my NID, so that I can access the tournament management features.
2. Player Selection
    *  As an organizer, I want to view a list of existing players, so that I can select players for the tournament.

    *  As an organizer, I want to create a new player if they are not in the existing list, so that I can ensure all participants are registered.

    *  As an organizer, I want to select up to 64 players for the tournament, so that I can ensure that the tournament has enough participants.

    *  As an organizer, I want to automatically fill any remaining spots with "bye players", so that I can complete the player list even if fewer than 64 players are selected.

3. Group Generation
    * As an organizer, I want to have 16 groups of 4 players generated from the selected players, so that each group is balanced and competitive.

    * As an organizer, I want to assign a table number (1-8) to each group, so that I can manage the matches more easily.

4. Match Creation
    * As an organizer, I want to create 6 matches for each group based on all unique player pairings, so that every player has the opportunity to compete against each other.

5. Result Collection
    * As an organizer, I want to collect results for the three sets played in each match, so that I can determine the winner of the match.

    * As an organizer, I want to set the winner of each match, so that the tournament can proceed to the next phase.

6. Advancement and Bracket Generation
    * As an organizer, I want to identify the top two players from each group after all matches are played, so that they can advance to the elimination phase.

    * As an organizer, I want to generate direct elimination brackets based on the top players, so that I can organize the final matches efficiently.

7. Final Matches and Champion Declaration
    * As an organizer, I want to collect results from each match in the elimination brackets, so that I can track who advances to the next round.

    * As an organizer, I want to determine the champion after the final match is played, so that I can officially conclude the tournament.
